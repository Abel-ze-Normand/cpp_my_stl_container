# cpp_my_stl_container

Example of implementation of vector, constructed from blocks of fixed size with built-in random access iterator. This features gives advatage in space usage in comparison with std::vector, and much better (theoretical) perfomance in comparison with usual list. Also included some tests to be sure in correctness of implementation
